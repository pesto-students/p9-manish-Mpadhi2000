function createIncrement() {     
let count = 0;    
function increment(){

let message =`Count is ${count}`;

}return[increment,log];   
}    
const[increment,log] = createIncrement();   
increment();   
increment();   
increment();   
log();

                                                      
**Explanation:**

1. The createIncrement function defines the count variable and initializes it to 0.

2. It also defines two functions, increment and log, which are returned as an array.

3. The increment function increments the count variable by 1 each time it is called. In this case, it is called three times.

4. The log function logs the current value of count to the console. However, it is defined at the time when count is still 0, and it does not update as count changes.

5. Therefore, the output of log() will be "Count is 0".
